  Added some checks to remove parameters from the parameter list if these
  have been marked for fitting but the model they belong to has not. Also
  removed the initialization checks for this parameters if they are not
  to be fitted.

  Changed the structure of the 'example.par' file, and also removed all the
  files from the CVS that are created by 'automake' and 'autoconf', since
  it only causes trouble when these files are used with different versions
  of 'automake' and 'autoconf'.
