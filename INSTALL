REQUIREMENTS
============
    cfitsio (for optional fits output)
    pgplot (not really used at the time)
  For developers:
    autoconf
    automake

  * NOTE if you are on physto.se and does not have a local version of
    autoconf/automake, begin by typing

      source /afs/physto.se/snova/dsk03/software/bin/setup.csh

  
COMPILE AND INSTALL
===================
The easiest way to install the software is to enter directory snoc/snalys
and type:

  ./configure
  make

This should produce a binary for your architecture. Currently i386 linux and
alpha OSF are supported but there is no reason why it will not work on other
platforms. The only thing you have to do is to compile the pgplot libraries
(snoc/lib/pgplot*.tar) for that specific architecture. To clean up the
object files type

  make clean

Before you want to compile the software for a different architecture type

  make distclean

and the type ./configure again. Good luck!

To run the program you also have to specify the environment variable
PGPLOT_DIR to point at the snoc/snalys/lib directory.

Developers using the CVS version has to type

  source /afs/physto.se/snova/dsk03/software/bin/setup.csh
  aclocal
  autoconf
  automake -a

to create the configure script and the 'Makefile.in' files.
